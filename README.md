# pwncheck

Mucking about with the API for `;-- and CouchDB for fun and profit.

Usage:
pwned [email].
Removed the interactive prompt if you don't provide an email - instead it will die with an error message with the proper usage outlined.

Currently requires couchDB to be up and running and will fail with errors if it can't detect or create a local database.
